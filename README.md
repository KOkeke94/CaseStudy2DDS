**Executive Summary**\
Project Overview:
This project aimed to analyze factors contributing to employee attrition and develop predictive models to forecast attrition likelihood and monthly income. By utilizing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), machine learning techniques including Naïve Bayes and linear regression, and cross-validation, the project explored key insights and built predictive models that could assist in HR decision-making.

**Key Findings**\
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Identified three primary factors influencing attrition (Job Role, Job Involvement, and Age).\
Observed higher attrition rates among specific job roles, indicating potential areas for HR intervention.

Naïve Bayes Model for Attrition Prediction:\
Utilized a Naïve Bayes model with an 80/20 train-test split.\
Achieved an accuracy of 82.76%, sensitivity of 85.62%, and specificity of 67.86% in predicting attrition status.

Linear Regression Model for Monthly Income Estimation:\
Employed forward selection and 10-fold cross-validation to develop a linear regression model.\
Achieved a root mean squared error (RMSE) of < $1000  on the training set and $1072.60 on the test set, meeting the RMSE threshold of <$3000.

**Implications**:\
The predictive models offer valuable insights for potential HR strategies, enabling the ability to use proactive measures to mitigate attrition risks and predict future employee compensation.\
With a focus on data-driven decision-making, organizations can leverage these models to enhance employee retention and optimize workforce management practices.
